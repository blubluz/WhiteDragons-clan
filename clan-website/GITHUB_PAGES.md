# Hosting Your Website for Free with GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages lets you host static websites (HTML, CSS, JS) for free. Hereâ€™s how to publish your site:

## 1. Create a GitHub Repository
- Go to https://github.com and sign in.
- Click the "+" icon (top right) > **New repository**.
- Name your repository (e.g., `clan-website`).
- Set it to **Public**.
- Click **Create repository**.

## 2. Upload Your Website Files
- On your computer, make sure all your site files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, etc.) are in one folder.
- Drag and drop all files into your GitHub repository (or use Git to push them).

## 3. Enable GitHub Pages
- Go to your repository on GitHub.
- Click **Settings** > **Pages** (in the left sidebar).
- Under **Source**, select the branch (usually `main`) and folder (`/root` if your files are in the main directory).
- Click **Save**.

## 4. Access Your Website
- After a few moments, GitHub will provide a link to your live site (e.g., `https://yourusername.github.io/clan-website/`).
- Share this link with others!

## Notes
- Only static files (HTML, CSS, JS) are supported. No server-side code.
- For updates, push changes to your repository and GitHub Pages will update automatically.

For more advanced hosting (dynamic sites, custom domains), consider free platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or Render.
